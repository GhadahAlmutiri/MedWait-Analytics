# Project Title: MedWait Analytics

## Overview

MedWait Analytics is a Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze waitlist data for various medical cases in hospitals and clinics. The dashboard aims to provide insights into wait times, performance metrics, and disparities across different specialties and age groups, ultimately enhancing the quality of service and patient care.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual representation of waitlist data using graphs, tables, and charts.
- **Summary Metrics**: Displays total waitlist numbers and comparisons between the current and previous months.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Breakdown of waitlist data by age groups and case types.
- **Detailed Insights**: Ability to drill down into data by specialty and other categories.
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data by timeframe, case type, and specialty for targeted analysis.

## Steps Used in the Project

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Data was extracted from multiple sources related to inpatient, outpatient, and day case data, along with specialty mapping files.

2. **Data Processing and Cleaning**:
   - The data was cleaned and organized, ensuring integrity and consistency. 
   - Raw data was transformed into an easily analyzable format, with added mappings linking specialties and other categories.

3. **Building the Analytical Model**:
   - A data model was created that connects various tables, allowing for comprehensive and in-depth analysis.
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average wait times and demographic groupings were set up.

4. **Dashboard Design**:
   - Interactive visualizations were created to display the data through graphs, tables, and charts.
   - The dashboard includes:
     - **Summary**: Displays total numbers and current vs. previous waitlists.
     - **Demographic Profile**: Shows distribution by age groups and case types.
     - **Detailed View**: Allows users to drill down into data based on specialties and different categories.

5. **Adding Interactive Filters**:
   - The dashboard is equipped with interactive filters such as:
     - Timeframe selection
     - Case type selection (outpatient, inpatient, etc.)
     - Specialty or age group selection

6. **Interpreting Results and Decision-Making**:
   - The dashboard allows users to understand patterns and trends in waitlist data.
   - It aids in data-driven decision-making to reduce wait times and enhance patient experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Power BI installed on your machine.
2. **Data Files**: Obtain the data files necessary for the dashboard from the project repository.
3. **Setup**: Open Power BI and import the data files to begin using the dashboard.
